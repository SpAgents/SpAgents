The axSpA diagnostic system uses four specialized agents: DataAgent retrieves patient clinical data from CSV databases and handles file uploads, ToolAgent integrates with external deep learning models (EdemaSystem) to process MRI images through two-stage segmentation and generate SPARCC scores across 12 anatomical regions, converting complex numerical outputs into structured text reports, PlannerAgent orchestrates the workflow by determining which agents to invoke based on user queries, and DoctorAgent synthesizes processed data from both DataAgent and ToolAgent to make final diagnostic decisions, combining clinical data with quantitative imaging scores to provide clinicians with automatically generated SPARCC scores for more accurate axSpA diagnosis.
